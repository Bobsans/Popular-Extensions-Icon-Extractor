Popular Extensions Icon Extractor
=================================

Simple Python script that extracts icons from the associated extensions of a Windows installation. It also converts them to PNG.

I coded it to get a set of popular icons of the common extensions, for use in [Infinite Web Folders](https://github.com/pereorga/infinite-web-folders)


Requirements
------------

+ Windows
+ Python
+ Python Imaging Library (PIL)
+ [Imagemagick (convert.exe)](http://www.imagemagick.org)
+ [IconsExtract](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/iconsext.html)
+ [FileTypesMan](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/file_types_manager.html)

Put filetypesman.exe and iconsext.exe in this folder.
